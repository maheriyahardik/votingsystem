Creating an Android-based Voting System for a diploma project in computer engineering is an excellent idea. Here's a detailed description that can help you articulate the project:

Project Title:
Android-Based Voting System

Project Description:
The Android-Based Voting System is a mobile application designed to facilitate secure, efficient, and user-friendly voting processes. The system aims to digitize traditional voting methods, making them more accessible and environmentally friendly while ensuring integrity and reliability.

This project is developed specifically for educational institutions, organizations, or small communities. Users can cast votes for elections, surveys, or other decision-making processes directly from their Android devices.

Objectives:
Efficiency: Simplify the voting process, reducing manual effort and time consumption.
Accessibility: Allow users to vote remotely from any location via their Android devices.
Security: Ensure that the voting process is secure using authentication and encryption methods.
Transparency: Provide real-time vote counting and detailed analytics for administrators.
Eco-Friendly: Minimize the use of paper and other physical resources.
Key Features:
User Registration and Login:

Users register with personal details and unique credentials (e.g., email/phone and password).
Authentication through OTP or biometric verification (optional).
Admin Dashboard:

Admins can create and manage elections or polls.
Real-time tracking of votes.
Voting Mechanism:

List of candidates or options displayed to users.
Users can cast their votes with a single click.
Confirmation screen before submitting the vote.
Results and Analytics:

Real-time tallying of votes.
Graphical representation of results (e.g., bar charts, pie charts).
Security Features:

Prevent duplicate voting using unique user IDs.
Encrypt data in transit and at rest to maintain confidentiality.
User-Friendly Interface:

Simple and intuitive UI/UX for easy navigation.
Compatibility with various screen sizes.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: Android Studio with Java/Kotlin for mobile app development.
Backend: Firebase, PHP with MySQL, or Node.js for server-side operations.
Database: Firebase Realtime Database or MySQL for storing user and voting data.
Authentication: Firebase Authentication or custom login system.
Additional Tools: Graph libraries for results visualization (e.g., MPAndroidChart).
Development Phases:
Requirement Analysis: Identify the scope, features, and user roles.
Design: Create wireframes and UI/UX designs.
Development: Build and integrate the frontend and backend components.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure security and reliability.
Deployment: Publish the app and provide user training.
Benefits of the Project:
Encourages digital transformation in voting systems.
Provides a scalable solution for small and medium-sized communities.
Highlights skills in mobile app development, database management, and security.
